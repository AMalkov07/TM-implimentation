Turing machine implementation in go language

# tooling
This program only uses the fmt package from the standard library\n
Note: a go mod file has to be created with `go mod init example.txt` to run this program

# Sources
TM.go
main.go

# Tests
main.go contains tests for the tripletm TM

# Status
I believe this is a fully functioning simulation for TM's
